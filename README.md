# ArchitectAI
This project is an idea for a startup. The goal of the project is to simplify communication between clients and architects. AI will reduce the time it takes for an architect to create a building drawing and help avoid a large number of revisions in the project.  
## How it works?
The client sets parameters, such as the size of the building, number of rooms, floors, etc., and the AI generates a drawing of the building. Once the client chooses a design, they can confirm details with the architect and make changes to the drawing.  
The use of AI in the construction industry will significantly improve the speed of creating projects and their quality, and will allow more work to be completed in less time. Architect AI is positioned as an online service that will collaborate with construction companies to improve customer listening and further development of the project.
