# ArchitectAI
This project is an idea for a startup. The goal of the project is to simplify communication between clients and architects. AI will reduce the time it takes for an architect to create a building drawinarchitectg and help avoid a large number of edits to the project.  
The client sets the program parameters, such as the size of the building, number of rooms, floors, etc., and the AI generates a drawing of the building. Once the client chooses a design, they can confirm details with the architect and make changes to the drawing.
